# Familiar-Project-Data-Analysis

Familiar is a startup in the new market of blood transfusion. Familiar has fallen into some tough times lately, so youâ€™re hoping to help them make some insights about their product and help move the needle (so to speak).

They have two different packages, the Vein Package and the Artery Package, that we will run some analysis on. First we want to show that the most basic package, the Vein Package, has a significant impact on the subscribers' lifespan. Next we want to see if we can find extra benefits from the Artery Package.
