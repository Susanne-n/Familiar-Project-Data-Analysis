# Familiar-Project-Data-Analysis

Familiar is a startup in the new market of blood transfusion. In this project we will help them make some insights about their products and help move the needle (so to speak).

They have two different packages, the Vein package and the Artery package, that we will run some analysis on. In the script there's an explanation with every analysis that I have run. In summary, the task was to find out what the influence of the use of these packages was on average lifespan and iron counts.
